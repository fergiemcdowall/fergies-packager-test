# fergies-packager-test
A repo for testing packaging strategies for modules including `level`

The motivation for this package is to find a consistent way to author
packages containing `level` that work on all platforms    

Targeted platforms:
  - React
  - Codepen
  - Node
  - <script> (umd)
  - <script type="module"> (esm, invoked with "import")
